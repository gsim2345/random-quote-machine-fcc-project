# random-quote-machine-fcc-project
freeCodeCamp's Build a Random Quote Machine challenge. The objectives were at being able to click a button that refreshes the quotes, and being able to press a button to tweet out a quote.

I used the Random Famous Quotes API from mashape.com to get quotes, and I used HTML, CSS and jQuery to display them.
